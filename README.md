# Introduction
### 👋 Hi, I’m Pascal Schirmer (@pascme05): 
I received the B. Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Applied Sciences, Esslingen, Germany, in 2018 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hertfordshire (UK) in 2021 respectively. Currently, I am responsible for the simulation of power electronic components at the BMW AG, especially considering the lifetime and reliability.   

### 👀 I’m interested in
I am an expert in the areas of data-driven modeling, regression, and prediction, with specific knowledge in the area of energy disaggregation and load forecasting. Further, my research interest covers electric drives and power electronics.
